## Better Mood

* Mood is influenced by diet and exercise.
* Exercise can improve mood, but research on the effect of diet on mood is contradictory.
* A good diet can help you lose weight, which will also improve your mood \[1]. Many people who are overweight or obese have poor eating habits and don't get enough sleep \[2]. People who exercise regularly tend to have better eating habits than those who don't \[3]. If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight will improve your energy levels and reduce stress \[4], which may make it easier for you to stick with an exercise program.

## Lower Risk of Many Diseases

You may have heard that losing weight can help you live a longer and healthier life. But did you know that it's also linked with lower risk of many diseases? These include heart disease, high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, diabetes, cancer, and even Alzheimer's disease.

One study found that losing between 10% and 20% of your body weight can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%. Another study found that losing 5% to 10% of your body weight could lower your risk for heart disease by 30%.

## Better Sleep

If you're overweight, losing weight can make a dramatic difference in how well you sleep. Here's why:

* Your sleep may improve because less body fat means less stress on your joints and muscles. This might help with restless sleep and snoring.
* You'll likely have less sleep apnea if you lose weight. Sleep apnea is caused by extra tissue in the throat that makes breathing difficult while sleeping, causing shallow breaths and loud snoring—which can disturb anyone else in your house.

## More Energy

As you lose weight, you will have more energy to do the things that you want. Even the smallest weight loss can make a big difference. This can be especially helpful if you have been struggling with fatigue or low energy levels.

One great way to increase your energy levels is by exercising regularly. Regular exercise has many benefits such as burning calories and building muscles, keeping your heart healthy, improving sleep patterns and reducing stress levels.

## Increased Confidence

Confidence is an important part of your life. It helps you to make decisions, meet new people and be more productive at work. Confidence also helps you to be more active and social, by helping you to overcome shyness and feel more comfortable in a group setting.

Being overweight can have negative effects on your confidence level. Studies show that being overweight can cause people to feel less attractive and less successful than they really are, leading them to shy away from social interactions or even avoid leaving their home altogether. This feeling of low self-esteem can lead to depression over time, which has been linked with several factors including heart disease, sleep apnea and diabetes (1).

## Longer Life Expectancy

Losing weight can help you live longer. If you are overweight or obese, losing even a small amount of weight may reduce your risk of dying from heart disease, cancer and other causes. Even if you lose only 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg), there is evidence that it will reduce the risk of developing diabetes by 50 percent or more.

Losing weight can improve your health as well as your appearance. Losing just 5 percent to 10 percent of your starting body weight can bring about significant improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, making it easier for you to avoid heart disease and stroke -- two leading causes of death in the United States. In addition, losing weight has been shown to reduce the symptoms associated with arthritis, back pain and other chronic conditions caused by obesity-related conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes that cause extra stress on joints and muscles throughout the body.

## You can achieve a healthy life when you start losing weight.

Losing weight is a process, not something that happens overnight. If you’re starting from the ground up, then your fat loss journey will be a long one. But if you work on losing just 10 pounds a year, over time those numbers add up to big results.

Now that we have established that weight loss is possible for everyone and we know how much effort goes into it — how do we actually get started?

It starts with taking action today! You can start by making small changes like drinking water instead of soda or eating more fruits and vegetables instead of fast food. These little things will help kickstart the process of becoming healthier overall!

description: Startups and small businesses are always looking for ways to
  improve their marketing strategies. One of the best ways to do that is by
  building a landing page. A landing page is a single web page designed to
  collect email addresses or other information from visitors in order to market
  products or services online.

Here's why you should create your own landing pages:

## Capture the attention of your visitors

When your visitors land on your landing page, you have about 8 seconds to capture their attention. If you fail to do this, they’ll likely bounce away from your site immediately. They only have a few moments to decide whether or not they want to stay and learn more about what your company has to offer them.

It’s important that your landing page is designed with this in mind. Not only should it be easy for visitors to find what they are looking for quickly, but it should also look professional and trustworthy so that visitors know that this is a legit business and not just someone trying to make money off these scammy ads I see everywhere on Facebook!

## Improve SEO rankings

The second reason to create a landing page is to improve your SEO rankings.

This may not be a goal for everyone, but if you’re in the e-commerce business or if you have an ad campaign that uses paid traffic, then this is something worth considering.

There are two main ways that creating a landing page can help with SEO:

* Improve authority and relevance of your site: This refers to how Google determines which websites are “best” in its search results. Websites with high authority tend to rank higher because they are seen as more trustworthy by Google. The best way to gain authority for your website is through links from other sites (also known as backlinks). Creating an effective landing page can increase the number of backlinks pointing at your site because people will link directly from their own pages and blog posts (including comments) when they share it on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter.

## Learn more about your audience

You can learn a lot about your audience by asking them questions.

* How old are they?
* What is their gender?
* Where do they live?

You can also learn a lot about your audience by observing them in their natural habitat. For example, if you're selling clothes, go to the mall and watch people's body language as they walk past your store window—their posture will tell you a lot about whether or not they're interested in what's inside! Similarly, observe how many people visit your site after reading an email campaign or social media post that mentions it; this information can help you determine whether or not it's worth expanding upon these marketing strategies (such as adding more content) or should be abandoned altogether (if there aren't enough visitors).

## Having a landing page can help your website rank higher in search engines and convert more visitors into paid customers.

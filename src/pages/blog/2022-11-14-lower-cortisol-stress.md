## Reduce stress.

While cortisol levels are generally high during the day, they are low at night. This is why you should get enough sleep to allow your body to relax and recharge. Also, consider making time for regular exercise or meditation; both can help you reduce stress.

If you don't have time for a full workout, try doing short stretches throughout the day and taking deep breaths as well. You may also want to practice yoga or another mind-body method that helps bring awareness into your body and its sensations.

## Find ways to be thankful.

You can do this by finding ways to be thankful. Write down or mentally acknowledge what you are grateful for every day, even if it is something small and seemingly insignificant. For example, if your child helps you with the dishes or brings home a good report card, this is an opportunity to write down “I am thankful that my child helped me clean up today” or “I am grateful that my daughter received straight A's on her report card!”

Remembering gratitude will help guide your thoughts away from dwelling on negative events in the past or worrying about what could go wrong in the future. This can help lower cortisol levels and reduce stress overall!

## Start your day with a prayer or meditation.

Start your day with a prayer or meditation.

Meditation helps you be more mindful of what you are doing and can help reduce stress. If you are not used to meditating, start by taking five minutes each day to sit quietly, close your eyes and focus on breathing. You can also use guided meditation apps such as Headspace or Calm for this purpose if you prefer.

## Eat less sugar, especially processed foods and refined grains.

* Sugar is addictive and can cause a spike in cortisol. The craving for sugar acts on the same receptors in your brain as do drugs like cocaine, which are known to increase cortisol levels. If you're eating too much sugar, it's likely that you don't even know how much stress it's causing—even if your blood work looks good!
* Sugar can cause blood sugar imbalances and inflammation. Eating lots of refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta or rice creates a spike in blood sugar levels that often leads to mood swings, fatigue and bloating (due to inflammation).
* Sugar overconsumption also frequently leads to weight gain, another source of stress!

## Increase your intake of Omega-3 fatty acids.

Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and have been shown to reduce the production of cortisol, so they can help address stress-related symptoms. Eating more fish, nuts, seeds and flaxseed will increase your intake. Other sources include chia seeds and walnuts. Eggs also contain small amounts of Omega-3s.

## Get enough sleep.

* Sleep is a time when the body repairs and rejuvenates itself. It's important for your body to get enough sleep because not getting enough can lead to weight gain, depression and diabetes.
* The recommended amount of sleep varies from person to person, but seven to eight hours per night is considered healthy. And it turns out that there are specific times during the day/night when you're more likely to wake up feeling rested—the best time for most people is from 10pm to 2am!

## Eat a healthy, anti-inflammatory diet.

* Eat a healthy, anti-inflammatory diet. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help lower cortisol levels because they are high in phytonutrients (plant nutrients) that help fight inflammation. Foods like dark leafy greens, berries, nuts and seeds can reduce the production of stress hormones. Eating more whole foods will also give you an energy boost and keep your blood sugar balanced.
* Avoid processed foods as much as possible. Processed foods are higher in unhealthy fats and refined carbohydrates that cause spikes in blood sugar levels—which increases the production of cortisol over time—and they often contain artificial ingredients that have been linked to inflammation.
* Eat less sugar if you want to lower your cortisol levels naturally through food choices alone; while sugar may not directly increase cortisol levels it also doesn't support them when taken regularly so it's best avoided altogether if possible (or at least consumed sparingly).

## A healthy, holistic approach to reducing stress can help you lose weight and be healthier overall.

Stress is a serious health problem that's often overlooked. It's not just the source of anxiety disorders like PTSD or OCD—the physical symptoms of chronic stress also include heart attacks, strokes, insomnia and even obesity. In fact, one study found that people with high levels of cortisol in their systems are more likely to be obese than those with lower levels (1). Overall, being under constant pressure has been linked with several serious illnesses like diabetes mellitus type II (DM2), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cancer (2).

The link between chronic stress and weight gain is undeniable—but how do we go about reducing it? There aren't any quick fixes here—in order for effective long-term change to occur in our lives we need something more substantial than just eating less sugar or exercising more often; we need real solutions that address both mind AND body equally!

## Conclusion

With some practice, you can create a healthier lifestyle that helps you lose weight and be happier. We all want to feel good and look great, but it’s important to remember that your health is more than just your appearance. It’s about feeling good inside and out!

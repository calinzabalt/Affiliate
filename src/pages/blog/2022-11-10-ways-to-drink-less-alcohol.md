## Experiment with non-alcoholic drinks.

* Try different drinks.
* Try different brands.
* Try different flavors.
* Try different recipes. If you're at a bar, ask the bartender for a recommendation based on what you usually like—they probably know their stuff! And if they don't, ask to see their menu and find something that looks good to you instead of settling for whatever they have behind the counter (unless it's exactly what you want).
* Experiment with non-alcoholic versions of your favorite alcoholic drinks—this can be especially fun when doing it with someone else! If one person orders an alcoholic drink and the other gets a mocktail version, this makes for great conversation fodder as well as an opportunity to share food or snacks between each other without having them get too drunk (or vice versa).

## Drink a glass of water between each drink.

While this may seem like a no-brainer, it's actually one of the most effective ways to drink less alcohol. The next time you're out at a bar or party and you feel a little buzzed, have another glass of water between each drink. If you've been drinking for several hours and feel completely intoxicated, stop drinking altogether for at least thirty minutes before taking another sip.

Take advantage of this simple trick by keeping some water nearby (with ice if possible) when going out so that when your friends are ordering rounds at the bar or getting up to dance with their friends, grab yourself some H2O instead! You'll feel fuller faster than if you just took in one long gulp from your beer stein every time someone went up for another round; plus staying hydrated helps prevent hangovers as well! Even better: having water between drinks will keep your tolerance level down so that even if someone else orders an extra strong cocktail or pint of beer (or three), it won't affect you nearly as much since your body isn't accustomed to those kinds of amounts yet anyway."

## Stop buying alcohol in large quantities.

* Stop buying alcohol in large quantities.
* If you already have a lot of alcohol at home, get rid of it. Reduce the amount of booze you keep on hand by getting rid of it or donating it to charity. If you drink wine or beer from a full-size bottle, switch to smaller bottles or cans; if you normally drink vodka straight from a full-size bottle, buy one with an ounce less (or use an empty mini-champagne bottle for your glass).

## Learn to moderate your drinking.

The premise of the Center for Science in the Public Interest's "DrinkWise" program is that drinking alcohol is a learned behavior. By teaching people how to moderate their drinking, they can learn to drink less or not at all.

In order to measure your drinks, use a standard shot glass or other small cup so you can see how much you're consuming. A standard shot glass holds 1.5 ounces while a standard beer glass holds 16 fluid ounces (about 473 milliliters). If you want an easy rule of thumb, once your level reaches two-thirds full, it's time to stop pouring!

Also, pay attention when drinking alcohol—you will know when it has had enough effect on your body by noticing its effects on yourself and others: If a person gets louder or more aggressive after having just one drink or if someone becomes incoherent after consuming multiple glasses of wine but still insists on having another glass before going home alone then there may be reason for concern about overdrinking."

## Choose the best wine for your health.

If you're going to drink wine, it's best to choose the healthiest option possible. For example, red wine is good for your heart. White wine is good for your brain. Rose wine is good for your skin and champagne is good for your teeth!

## Have a plan for socializing without alcohol.

The first step to avoiding alcohol is to have a plan. If you know that you won't be drinking, plan what you're going to do. Will you go out? Of course! Just not with alcohol.

Plan ahead of time what non-alcoholic drink(s) you will order and how many drinks they come in so that the bartender doesn't need to ask every time he or she sees your empty glass on the table next to yours (which can be awkward). And if there are people in your party that choose not to drink at all, make sure everyone gets something different so it's obvious who has not been drinking and who has been!

Bring money for an Uber/taxi/whatever transportation service is available should anyone need one when leaving the venue—and know how much it costs before heading out so there aren’t any surprises later on at night when someone needs help getting home from wherever they’re partying

## Eat before you drink.

If you’re having a glass of wine or a drink with dinner, eating before you drink will slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream. That means that instead of feeling tipsy after a few sips, you might actually feel more sober and less inclined to overindulge in order to catch up with everyone else at the table.

To avoid making the situation worse by eating something unhealthy (a processed snack like chips), try eating some fruit or nuts instead. If time allows, have an actual meal before drinking—you can even make it extra healthy by choosing foods that are high in protein or fiber so they’ll fill you up without leaving you hangry!

## Cut back by cutting out the worst offenders.

* Cut back on beer and wine. Beer and wine are the two most popular alcoholic beverages, to the tune of $15 billion in annual sales in the U.S., but they're also some of the highest in calorie content.
* Avoid vodka and whiskey. Vodka is distilled from any grain or potato—basically, it's just a neutral spirit that takes on its flavor from what you mix it with (like fruit juice). Whiskey is made from mashed grains like barley, rye, corn or wheat; this process results in varying flavors depending on which type of grain was used as an ingredient. Be aware that flavored vodkas tend to have more calories than unflavored ones—for example: cranberry vodka has about 180 calories per shot vs. plain vodka which only has about 96 calories per shot!
* Don't drink liqueurs unless you absolutely love them because they pack more sugar into each serving than regular alcohol does—and aren't exactly low-calorie drinks themselves either! Most liqueurs contain 40% alcohol content so keep this in mind when ordering your next cocktail!

## Join an online community of people who are working to reduce their alcohol intake too.

If you're struggling to make changes on your own, consider joining an online community of people who are working to reduce their alcohol intake. Online communities offer the benefit of a support network without the in-person awkwardness or cost of joining a group. You can find an online community at any time of day or night, and there are plenty available for every budget—from free forums to paid counseling services.

## You can learn to drink less and still have an active social life

You can learn to drink less and still have an active social life. There are many ways to do this, including joining an online community and learning how to moderate your drinking. You can also learn how to stop buying alcohol in large quantities.

## Conclusion

It’s not easy to make a change like this, but it is possible. There are plenty of resources out there to help you do it—whether they take the form of online communities or apps that monitor your alcohol intake and offer reminders when it’s time for a break. You can also try some of the tips listed above, like cutting back on certain types of alcohol or replacing drinking with other activities that don’t involve alcohol at all (like playing sports). The most important thing is to just keep trying!

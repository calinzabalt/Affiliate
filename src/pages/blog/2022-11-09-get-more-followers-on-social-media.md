title: Get more followers on social media

description: Social media marketing can be a highly effective way to reach
  potential customers. The beauty of this type of promotion is that it’s
  cost-effective, and you can get your message in front of people who are
  actively looking for something related to your business or industry. But if
  you want to build an engaged following on social media, it takes time and
  effort on your part — and sometimes even money. So why bother? First off,
  research shows that posts shared by brands or individuals with an engaged
  following receive more likes, comments and shares than those posted by
  less-engaged users (or even bots). Secondly, engaging with fans directly
  allows them to connect with each other as well as share content they like with
  others — which leads us back again to the first point about word-of-mouth
  being more powerful than most forms of advertising

## Set Goals.

One of the most important steps you can take is to set goals. A goal is something that you want to achieve, and it's helpful to define your goals before starting a social media marketing strategy because it will help you stay on track as you go along. Goals are also necessary for measuring progress—if you don't know where you're going, how will you know if and when you've arrived?

The first step in setting goals is understanding what kind of things would make your brand feel successful. If a brand sets a goal like “I want 1 million followers within 6 months” and doesn't achieve it, they might feel disappointed or frustrated, even though that wasn't actually an attainable goal (we'll talk more about this later). But if they set a more modest goal like “I want 100 new followers per week for three months” then they can measure their success based on whether or not this was achieved each week over time.

## Research your target audience.

The first step in getting more followers is knowing who you want to follow you. This requires some research. Find out the demographics of your target audience, what they like and dislike, where they hang out online, and how best to reach them. If your target audience is young women between 18-30 years old who are interested in fashion, then start Instagramming photos of clothes and makeup—not of yourself or random wildlife shots (no matter how cute). If your objective is to attract men between 25-45 who are interested in politics and sports, then post memes related to current events or pictures from last night's game rather than quizzes about whether their pet snake would survive in the wild (it probably wouldn't).

Once you've identified your ideal audience and figured out how best to reach them on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, it's time for the next step: actually building up those numbers by engaging with others on those platforms!

## Share the right content in the right place at the right time.

You should also share content at the right time. This is important because if you post something late in the evening, people might not see it until the next day, which means you’re missing out on that 24-hour window of opportunity.

On top of sharing at the right time, be sure to share your content in the right place. If your target audience isn’t following you on Twitter or Facebook, then posting there won’t do much good for getting more followers. Instead, try Instagram where people are more likely to follow brands they like and share their photos with friends as well as other social networks like LinkedIn where professionals tend to congregate.

## Be relevant.

The key to getting more followers on social media is to be relevant.

As you write your content, think about what your target audience would like and then deliver it. Just as you want your customers to respond to marketing messages that are applicable and relevant, they will do the same with your social media posts if they are targeted toward them in a way that makes sense. Also consider how the post might be shared by users who follow others similar to yours (and vice versa). If there's some kind of connection between either of these groups, then chances are good that those connections will share your content—which means more potential eyeballs seeing it!

## Add a personal touch.

* Add a personal touch.

If social media is used in the right way, it can be a great tool for getting your name out there and building a loyal following. However, there's no magic formula for gaining popularity on social media. It takes consistent effort on the part of both you and your followers to make it happen. First and foremost, remember that being genuine and honest is key to attracting people to you or your brand; if you're not being authentic, then why should anyone bother listening?

* Be consistent: The best way to get noticed by others is by maintaining regular activity on all platforms where they can find you—and that means being consistent across platforms like Twitter (where many companies like ours have active accounts) as well as Facebook or Instagram where we may not have official pages set up yet but still use them when posting content relevant

## Encourage engagement.

A key component of any social media strategy is encouraging engagement. If you don't take a proactive approach to encouraging the discussion, your followers will likely be more passive and less likely to interact with your posts.

Here are some ways that you can encourage engagement:

* Respond to comments and questions in a timely manner. This shows other users that you're engaged in their discussions and willing to answer their questions.
* Ask questions of your followers as well, so they feel like they have a say in what happens on the platform.
* Post photos with calls-to-action (CTAs) for people to click on or comment about something specific within the image—or better yet, set up an actual contest using one of these CTAs! You could ask people what they think about an upcoming event or give them exclusive access through contests like this one from Burger King® Canada: http://bitly/2fRK8IJ They gave away free Whopper® sandwiches every time someone posted #BurgerKingWinning Caption Contest by uploading an original caption on Instagram Stories; then BKC would pick out 100 winners per day for 5 days straight!

## Use hashtags wisely.

* Use hashtags that are relevant to your content.
* Don't overuse hashtags.
* Don't use too many hashtags in a single post.
* Don't use too many hashtags in a single tweet.

## Tell great stories.

Your brand’s stories should be about you, your customers, and the world around you.

Use pictures to tell a story. A few good photos are all it takes for people to start feeling like they know you and understand your values—and that's what gets them following you on social media in the first place.

Use videos to tell a story. Videos are more engaging than photos because they can communicate more information in less time, plus they have an emotional impact that still images can't touch.

## Offer special promotions to followers and fans only.

* Offer special promotions to followers and fans only.
* Use a special hashtag or code, so they can let you know they've seen the offer.
* Give access to exclusive content, such as behind-the-scenes photos or videos.
* Offer discounts on products or services.
* Give away prizes, like gift cards or coupons for your business' store or website.
* Ask for feedback on your products and services by emailing followers directly with questions about them

## Cross-promote on other social channels, email, etc..

You can cross-promote your content on other social channels with the use of a few tools. You may already be doing this, but if you’re not, it’s time to start.

You can use Twitter and Instagram to promote your Facebook posts while sharing links on LinkedIn will get you more traffic from Google searches. If you have an email list, send out an email each time you post something new—that way you can remind them to check out what they might have missed.

Don't forget that there are also many other ways to cross-promote your content across multiple platforms:

* Use the "share" feature at the bottom of each post so that when someone clicks it, they're taken directly back to where they were before reading (like YouTube does)
* Add social media icons throughout your website/blog (and don't forget about Pinterest!) so readers can easily find them when sharing interesting articles or blogs with friends online

## Engage with your audience beyond just posting content — respond to their tweets, answer questions and comments on Facebook, Instagram and others.

Responding to comments, questions and tweets is a great way to engage with your audience. You can be responsive and helpful while showing that you're open to feedback. Be personable and friendly, but remember not to overdo it. It's okay if your social media accounts aren't as personal as Snapchat or Instagram Stories; people don't want an unfiltered look into how you spend every moment of your day (unless they're already friends with you).

Being authentic is key when engaging with followers on social media: don't try too hard! If someone makes a snarky comment, respond back with grace and humour rather than anger or sarcasm—it'll earn their respect and trust far more than creating angry rants about "what people today don't understand about proper etiquette."

## Building an engaged following takes time and effort but is worth it

Building an engaged following takes time and effort but is worth it. As the saying goes: “out of sight, out of mind”. The more followers you have and the more they engage with your posts, the less likely they are to unfollow or stop engaging with your content altogether.

There are two main ways to increase follower engagement on social media: posting great content that people want to share, and responding appropriately when someone engages with your post.

## Conclusion

Building a strong social media following is not always easy, but it is definitely worth the effort. The best way to do this is by creating content that you know your audience will enjoy and then sharing it with them in the right place at the right time. You can also try cross-promoting on other channels like email or blogs as well as engaging with your audience beyond just posting content — respond to their tweets, answer questions and comments on Facebook, Instagram and others.

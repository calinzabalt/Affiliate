## [Fitbit Charge 5](https://amzn.to/3XsW6lg) Advanced Fitness & Health Tracker with Built-in GPS, Stress Management Tools, Sleep Tracking, 24/7 Heart Rate

* Fitbit Charge 5 is an advanced fitness and health tracker.
* The built-in GPS lets you accurately measure your distance, pace, speed and other stats in real time during exercise.
* Use the Relax app to manage your stress levels with guided breathing sessions within a calming experience that will help you stay focused on the moment.
* Sleep Stages uses heart rate variability (HRV) technology to monitor how well you sleep at night so you can get better rest and feel more energized in the morning.

## A DESIGN FOR EVERYONE

**[Fitbit Charge 5](https://amzn.to/3XsW6lg)** is the most advanced fitness tracker in its class. Its new design is both lightweight and comfortable, while its larger display makes it easier to read at a glance.

Fitbit Charge 5 is smaller than previous models, but gives you more of what matters - a bigger screen that shows your stats in more detail, plus longer battery life so you can wear it every day for almost two weeks before needing to charge again.

## ADVANCED HEALTH & FITNESS FEATURES

* Heart rate sensor: The Charge 5's continuous heart rate monitoring allows you to get a more complete picture of your activity. It also measures resting heart rate, which is a helpful indicator of health.
* All-day activity tracking: Track steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned and active minutes. With automatic goal setting for workouts and activities like yoga or running, the Charge 5 automatically adjusts your daily step count based on your own personal goals—so there's no need to manually set targets or create workout plans every day.
* Sleep tracking: Monitor how long it takes you to fall asleep (and wake up), how many times during the night you wake up and how much time you spend in light sleep versus deep sleep so that you can get a better sense of how well rested you are feeling in the morning.

## 7+ DAY BATTERY LIFE AND MORE

The Charge 5 is the first tracker to have a seven-day battery life. It also comes with a charger, so you don't have to worry about keeping it charged. Additionally, this tracker is waterproof and sweat-, rain-, and splash-resistant.

The Charge 5 will track your sleep with its all-new Sleep Stages—a feature that provides deeper insights into your nighttime rest through heart rate variability (HRV). This feature also allows you to track stress levels throughout the day using Guided Breathing sessions or guided workouts that guide users through breathing exercises designed to ease tension and calm muscles before bedtime.

In addition to its fitness tracking features, the Charge 5 includes an advanced fitness & health dashboard where you can see all of your stats in one place: steps taken per day; distance traveled throughout each week; calories burned from exercise and much more!

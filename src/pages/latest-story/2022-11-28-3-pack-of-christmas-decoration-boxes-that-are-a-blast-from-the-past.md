## Christmas is no doubt one of the most beloved holiday seasons all over the world.

It is a time to celebrate and have fun with family, friends and loved ones. The celebration is all about the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem who came to save us from our sins. It’s a good time for people to reflect on their lives and the lives of those around them so that we can live better lives than before.

Christmas decorations are items used at Christmas time to decorate homes or other places when celebrating Christmas. Decorations include lights, trees, garlands, wreaths, cards and much more. There are also many modern ways of decorating houses such as candles or fairy lights instead of traditional light bulbs which can be expensive depending on how many you use!

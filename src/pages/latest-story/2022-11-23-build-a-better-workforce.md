## What is productivity?

Productivity is a measure of how much you get done in a given period. It can be measured in terms of the time it takes to do something, or the quality of what's produced. If your goal is to produce something with quality, then measuring productivity by time alone doesn't make sense—you might not have an exact number for how long it took to do something, but you can still tell whether it took longer than expected or not.

However you define productivity—and whatever metrics are used to measure it—it's important because it increases your return on investment from all sources of capital (cash and non-cash) such as labor and materials. A business with low productivity will either need more investment in its workforce or higher prices for its products in order to make more money; conversely, businesses with high productivity can charge less for their products while still turning a profit

## Why are some employees productive while others are not?

Productivity is a complex phenomenon that can be influenced by a number of factors, such as work environment and culture. A manager's role is to make sure that the company's employees are productive enough to reach its goals.

It’s important to understand what makes people productive so you can hire the right people for your job openings. Understanding how each individual works will help you create an environment that suits their needs and motivates them to be successful.

## How can remote teams stay productive?

* Communication is key to a remote team's success. Make sure you have a good communication tool that allows you to communicate with your team members and customers in real-time. A shared calendar where all the team members can view the schedules of others will help keep projects on track, too.
* Ensure that your team has a good project management tool for monitoring costs, resources and deadlines for each project or task it undertakes.
* A collaboration app should be used by every member of the team to share ideas, materials and documents so everyone can stay informed about each other's progress on projects at all times.
* Task tracking apps allow each member of a group or department to post tasks for one another (and their supervisor) to see in one place; this helps prevent work from falling through cracks when priorities change suddenly due to emergencies or changes in direction from upper management

## How do you know when it's time to hire more employees?

* When you need to scale: If your business is growing and you are having trouble with the workload, adding employees can help.
* When you’re running out of work: If there is more demand for your services than you can handle alone, hiring more staff will be a smart move.
* When your employees can't handle the workload: When an employee reaches their capacity and they're struggling to complete tasks on time or under pressure, it's time to bring in some extra help.
* When they’re stressed and unhappy: Employees who are stressed out will not be able to do their best work, so it’s important that their workload is manageable -- if not enjoyable!

## How do you train new employees effectively?

The most effective method of training new employees is a combination of on-the-job and classroom training. On-the-job training allows for direct observation of an employee’s work performance, which allows for immediate feedback from supervisors and managers. Classroom settings provide additional time for training in more specific tasks related to your organization’s culture, such as how you conduct meetings or what is expected when giving presentations.

There are several reasons why this combination works so well:

* On-the-job instruction can be tailored specifically to the individual needs of each trainee. A new hire who is struggling with basic computer skills will not be taught advanced software in a classroom setting; instead, they would benefit most from hands on practice with simple computer programs like Microsoft Word or Excel. A student who has limited English proficiency would learn best by having a native speaker sit with them during their first few weeks on the job rather than being put into large groups where his language barrier would hinder his ability to follow along with what was happening around him.
* Classroom instruction provides an opportunity for more generalized skill development such as improving public speaking skills or learning about company culture (we go over this further down).

## How can you keep your top performing employees from leaving the company for a higher paying job somewhere else?

If you want to keep your top performing employees from leaving the company for a higher paying job somewhere else, you need to make sure they are happy.

You may think this is easy: just pay them more money! But it's not that simple; if all they want is money and nothing else, then they won't stay at your company for very long because there will always be someone willing to pay them more each year. So instead of just offering higher salaries, consider these other ways of building a better workforce:

* Make sure they feel valued by giving them opportunities for growth. If your best employee has been doing the same thing day after day without learning anything new or getting any additional responsibilities or challenges, then that person will be bored and looking elsewhere if something comes along with more opportunities than what their current role offers. The best way to prevent this scenario is by making sure that everyone in the organization feels like they're part of something bigger than themselves—and one way you can do that is by regularly giving out promotions and bonuses (more on those later).
* Reward hard work with recognition from management as well as colleagues who appreciate what an awesome job was done by someone else within the company! This could mean giving gift cards during special holidays such as Christmas or Thanksgiving; praising coworkers' efforts during morning meetings before their co-workers arrive at work; sending flowers after someone goes above-and-beyond expectations on a project...anything goes here! The key here though: don't forget about recognizing people even when no one else does (meaning don't wait until there's an award ceremony taking place). It doesn't take much time out of anyone's busy week either--just letting someone know how much value they add every day matters too much not be acknowledged now matter how small or insignificant it might seem at first glance.* Pay fairly but don't necessarily offer higher salaries unless specifically requested by employee(s)

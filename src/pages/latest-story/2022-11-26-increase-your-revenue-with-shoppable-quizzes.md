## Make sure you promote your quiz

The best way to promote your quiz is by using the following tactics:

* Social media: Create a Facebook and/or Instagram ad. Post it on your company's Facebook page with an enticing offer, like 10% off a purchase or two-for-one tickets to an event.
* Email marketing: Send out an email newsletter that includes a link to the quiz and a reminder about how taking it can lead to increased revenue. You can also include links in other places, such as on the homepage of your website or in the footer of all emails sent from customer service accounts (if applicable). When possible, add tracking codes so you can see which campaigns are bringing you more customers or leads!
* Paid advertising: There are many different types of paid advertising platforms out there—Google AdWords being one of them! Use these platforms for search engine optimization purposes only (SEO) if possible; otherwise pay per click (PPC) will suffice just fine too! Just make sure whatever platform(s) chosen adhere well enough with general search engine algorithm rules before proceeding any further into campaign setup process because failure do so may result into losing money after spending months building up strength behind brand name recognition through various channels such as social media platforms etcetera."

## Build your email list with quizzes

One of the most effective ways to increase your revenue is by building your email list. With a strong email marketing strategy, you can connect with customers and continue to offer them value as they move through their buying journey.

In order to do this, you need to create an engaging experience that allows people to get more information about topics they care about and build their relationship with your brand. You can use quizzes as a way of collecting data on customer preferences so that you can better understand what products might be best for them. Quizzes also make it easier for customers who are ready to buy something right away because they provide instant gratification: all they have to do is answer a few questions instead of spending time looking through pages of product reviews or scrolling through Instagram feeds full of ads.

If someone completes one of my quizzes, I give them access immediately so they don’t have any barriers between themselves and what they want (which is usually other content). By providing direct links into these areas within my site—for example by sending an email right after taking the quiz—I’m able build relationships quickly with those potential leads who might not otherwise know how much value there would be in working together down the road (or even finding out who exactly needs help).

## Create a beautiful landing page

* Use a landing page builder.
* Make sure your landing page is mobile friendly.
* Add a quiz to your landing page. Make it shoppable with an interactive shopping cart and product selector if you have multiple products that are similar but not exactly the same, such as several different kinds of running shoes or different sizes of tee shirts. Also, include the ability for users to share the quiz with friends via social media or email using buttons in the navigation bar on their phones. If applicable, add a call to action button asking them to sign up for your mailing list so they’re notified when new items become available!
* Ask for an email address so that you can send this group personalized emails with news about new products or sales once they shop through their quiz link.*

## Quizzes allow you to connect with your audience in a personal way in exchange for their email address, allowing you to market to them as often as you want.

You can use quizzes to connect with your audience in a personal way, in exchange for their email address. This means that you can market to them as often as you want, and the more relevant your messages are, the better.

You should also consider sending them emails based on their interests. For example, if someone takes a quiz about running and then receives an email about running shoes every time they visit your site, it’s likely that they will be more engaged with what you have to say than if they just randomly get emails from time-to-time.
